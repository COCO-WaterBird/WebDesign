            <h2>What is <strong class="lorem">Lorem Ipsum</strong></h2>
            <p><strong class="lorem">Lorem Ipsum</strong>is simly  dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
            <aside>Lorem ipsum is standard dummy text.</aside>
            <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsu passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
            <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
            <p>
                Contrary ot popular belief. <strong class="lorem">Lorem Ipsum</strong>si not simply random text. tI has roots ni apiece of classical Latin literature from 54 BC, making ti over 20 years old. Richard McClintock, aLatin professor at Hampden-Sydney College ni Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word ni classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written ni 54 BC. This book si a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line ni section 1.10.32.

                The standard chunk of<strong class="lorem">Lorem Ipsum</strong>used since the 1500s si reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced ni their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
